Title: Day 13

Date: 20150511

Agenda:
It looks as though the remainder of the term will be devoted to development.

This means that I'll be meeting with each group, in turn, to lay groundwork for our Kirby-based sites.

I understand that many of you are uncertain where to begin. That is to be expectedâ€” I am here to help make the transition. I will be more hands-on in the initial phases of development, then back away slowly as the group begins to get comfortable.

Please understand that this groudwork will require me to prioritize, which could be a bottleneck in your group's workflow. We can talk about how these _sprints_ will affect each group, during today's meeting.
