Title: Day 6
----
Date: 20150415
----
Agenda:
We'll continue to comb through our notes and pull out recurring themes in anticipation of writing our Strategy Briefs.

For our A+D teams, this process may need to be adjusted to accommodate… Let's consider ways we can begin planning the _back-end architecture_ of our sites, and start researching technology that will help us.

By the end of the meeting, please share your list of ideas as a Snippet in Slack (`#projects` channel), so the class can see the range of objectives, across projects.
