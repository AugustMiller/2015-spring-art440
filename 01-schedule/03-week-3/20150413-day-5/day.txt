Title: Day 3
----
Date: 20150406
----
Agenda:
Today, our A+D Projects team will meet.

Meanwhile, the rest of us will collate client meeting notes and begin to define objectives.

----
Notes:
- Share advice with A+D from prior meetings?
- Bye, A+D! (Reconvene at 10:30ish?)
- Remainder of us will begin transforming notes into goals.
-- Look over strategy brief, scope of work, again.
- Technology
-- Revising the Blueprint, via the idea of a CMS
--- Making the storage and display of like information easy.
--- Notion of a blog post shouldn't change from post to post, so why continue to redefine it?
---- Let's define *the idea of a blog post* once.
-- New repo! Check it out.
--- Clone (PC Users, use different path… C:\xampp\htdocs\, I think)
--- Create account
--- Add Yourself
---- Markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
-- No links? Let's add them.
--- PHP tags, Short Echo, html::a(…)
-- Student pages looking a little dull.
--- Let's compile the CSS and see what happens.
---- Koala, or…
---- `gem install sass`, `sass --update sass/students.sass:css/students.css`
--- Nice. Everyone got the same resulting CSS from the same collection of Sass files.
- Go home early? Damn.
