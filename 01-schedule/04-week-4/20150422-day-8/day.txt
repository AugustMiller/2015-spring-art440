Title: Day 8

Agenda:
Let’s start with another “Stand-up.” Be sure to answer the three questions:
- What happened since last time?
- What are you doing between now and our next meeting?
- Are there any blocking obstacles?

Because we have our Strategy Briefs out, we can talk about a couple of exercises that will help us start establishing a detailed outline of our websites’ pages and content.

Notes:
- Stand-Up
- "Information Architecture"
-- What information do I need to show, and how do I show it?
-- Re-visit BeHonest GitHub tickets
- Work through BeHonest Blueprints and the Panel with Donna
-- Add 4 Students
-- Adjust templates to suit (columns, lists, etc.)
-- Show this to the class, once we have things set up?
