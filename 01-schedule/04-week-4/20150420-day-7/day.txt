Title: Day 7
----
Date: 20150420
----
Agenda:
Today, we'll be wrapping up our Strategy Briefs and delivering them to our clients. When you send them, include a date by which you expect to hear back.

Upon delivery, we can take a moment to talk about our schedules as a group. This will be a good chance for us to come up with a framework for our remaining class meetings.

I will be available for the entire class time to help with last-minute edits to the strategy brief. We should plan to wrap up by 11:00AM, so we can run through some of the lead-up work on BeHonest. I'll continue to stub out the remainder of the projects this week, in anticipation of a quick and painless design phase.
