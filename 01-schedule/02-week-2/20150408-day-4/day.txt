Title: Day 4
----
Date: 20150408

Agenda:
The day we've all been waiting for! Clients will arrive at 9:30AM.

This is your opportunity to deliver your questions, and have a productive, optimistic conversation about what we can do for them.

----
Notes:
- Client Meetings
-- Introduce yourselves
-- Keep it conversational
-- Ask follow-up questions
-- Record words, ideas and intonation
-- Defend your craft. Don't let this be a time for art direction (but let them express preferences)
-- Look at things as they come up

- Recap
-- What did you learn?
-- Anything to share about the process with your classmates?

- What's next?
-- Strategy brief. Re-look at ScriptEd?

- Further:
-- Unknown. Flex time.

----
Concepts:
Client Relationships, Asking Questions, Opening Dialogues
----
Checklist:
- Be ready with your questions and note-taking materials. Clients will arrive at 9:30AM.
- We have not yet received confirmation from A+D Projects. This group's meeting will be postponed, but I am actively pursing the lead.
