Title: Day 3
----
Date: 20150406
----
Agenda:
Let's go over the questions you drafted, this weekend. We'll discuss what makes a good question, and fill in any gaps.

We'll also continue with our collaborative Git work with (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/blueprints text: Blueprints), (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/templates text: Templates) and the (link: http://getkirby.com/docs/panel/ text: Kirby Panel).

Remember how cool it was when we saw a beautiful form displayed from just a few lines of YAML? Wait until we fill it out, and build a template.

----
Notes:
- Try `$ php -S localhost:8000` immediately.
- Install XAMPP, Koala if on PC, MAMP if on OS X.
- Running a web server
- Recap on blueprints. Show completed YAML file and the form it generates.
-- See how this is better than writing HTML?
-- Things to keep in mind about YAML/Blueprints (whitespace, field names)
- Fill out the form, and see what happens in the `content` folder.
- But where is all our stuff, when we view the site?

- Templates
-- Look at `templates/default.php` or `templates/error.php`, and corresponding Blueprints
- What is a template?
-- A way of simplifying development for many pages that contain similar content
-- Think about a blog
-- "DRY programming"
- Creating a new template
-- Same name as the blueprint, but in `site/templates` instead of `site/blueprints`
-- HTML works, but…
-- How do we get that data? (Look at `default` and `error` templates!)
--- We need PHP.
--- PHP tags, echo tags
--- `snippet('name')`
--- `$page` object, `<?= $page->field_name() ?>`
-- Go!

- One-on-one meetings
-- Show me your work and speak briefly about your favorite project.
-- What do you like/dislike about code?
-- Where did you leave off?
-- Can/Should I push you to explore new technology?
-- How has class been, so far? Fast/slow/easy/hard/confusing, anything.

Checklist:
- Have your list of client questions ready to share.
- Collect some work (and keep it handy— or post a link to Slack) so that we can look it over during one-on-one check-ins.
- Read up on the linked items in today's agenda. Even if they don't stick, you'll have them on hand for some solo work time.
- If you're working on a PC, please (link: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-simple-php-application/getting-started-with-php/install-php-on-windows-7 text: install XAMPP) so that we can get started with development right away. No action is required for OS X users.
