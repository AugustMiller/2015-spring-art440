Agenda:
Hi, there! Nice of you to join us.

Due to some uncertainty about the number of available clients, we will be spending the first couple of weeks doing some review on fundamental web technology, and begin looking at a few additional languages and tools.

We'll also open a dialog regarding the structure of interactive design jobs, including process, services and roles that allow us to work effectively at scale, even when distributed.
