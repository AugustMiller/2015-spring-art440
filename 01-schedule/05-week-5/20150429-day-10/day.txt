Title: Day 10

Date: 20150429

Agenda:
Stand-ups have been going well— let’s start there. I’d like to add one question for this check-in, though.

_What skill were you most interested in developing this term?_

This is an important line of inquiry, because it will help me determine what group lessons to plan for the remainder of the term.

We're about to drop into four of five weeks of intense development work, and your guidance will be instrumental in figuring out what techonological or procedural pieces of collaborative web projects I’ll need to teach or take on as a member of your teams.

- I put this here so it wouldn’t say “Nothing to worry about, today…”
