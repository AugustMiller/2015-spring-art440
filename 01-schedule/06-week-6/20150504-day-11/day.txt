Agenda:
Congratulations to everyone that participated in BeHonest!

Today, we'll address a couple of technology topics that came up during Wednesday's Stand-up.

Don't worry! There will be time in the second half of class to work within your groups. I'd like to check in again with each group and find out how I can contribute to a painless transition into development.

-- What is an Application? Instagram?
--- Presentation layer (Experience: Interface, Apperance)
--- Service (Backend Architecture)

-- We're building an application! (Using Kirby)
--- Define the backend architecture (Blueprints)
--- Leverage an existing API (Kirby)

--- Conventions (Blueprint, Template, Controller names, i.e. `event` or `page`)
--- API (Most page methods, data accessors)
...
-- Mobile Adaptation
--- A new kind of matching
---- Selectors (Class, tag, etc.)
