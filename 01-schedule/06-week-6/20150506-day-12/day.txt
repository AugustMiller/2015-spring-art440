Title: Day 12

Agenda:
It seems as though weâ€™re nearing the tipping point for engineering in most projects.

I'll be meeting with each group to define content types and blueprints as well as polish information architecture.

Wish the CoLevity team good fortune as they present their designs to Cami! We should look to them to share we the rest of us how their meeting went, after the fact.
