----
Description:
Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets are an incredible distillation and expansion of CSS. We'll be using this *preprocessor* to make our stylesheets much easier to manage when working collaboratively.

A simple `$ gem install sass` and `$ sass --watch source.sass:destination.sass` will get you on your wayâ€” don't worry, though, we'll cover this in class.
