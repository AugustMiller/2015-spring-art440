Title: GitHub
----
Description:
GitHub is the keystone in software development.

The software "Git" is used to *version-control* a code project, by keeping track of changes that users make. Multiple users can add changes to a centralized code *repository* that can then be fetched and integrated by other users, seamlessly.

GitHub, appropriately, is the hub of activity for collaborating software developers like yourselves that use Git to manage their code.
